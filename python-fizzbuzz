'''This is a very common programming question. It's often on job interviews and a buzzword in the industry as a simple but common task to show your understanding.
Open a new Python file, fizzbuzz.py.
● Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 101.
● But, for multiples of three, print “Fizz” instead of the number.
● For multiples of five, print “Buzz”.
● For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print “FizzBuzz”.'''

for i in range(1,102):
    if i%3 == 0 and i%5 == 0:
        print('FizzBuzz')
    elif i%3 == 0:
        print('Fizz')
    elif i%5 == 0:
        print('Buzz')
    else:
        print(i)
